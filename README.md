# Machine stability control documentator
Name chosen to not confuse with MSDoc.

### Projects start
Whilst looking for a suitable next project I got asked what would it need to have app as somethig like paint but elements that
can be later modified and opened again and if needed, it could be printed.
I began to think about this and these are the steps I took to begin developing this app.

I searched through the web for something ready to be expanded upon but didn't find anything suitable.
That led me to search suitable Frameworks or libraries which could handle some of the UI so that the app wouldn't be needed to build
from the ground up.
The language didn't matter to me as long as the Framework/library would do some of the heavy lifting on the background.
After a while I ended up with two candidates. QT and WxWidgets. QT has paywall of sorts in some parts so I decided to go with 
WxWidgets which also supports multiple platforms although the main focus at the moment is to get the app to work with Windows first.

Learning WxWidgets has taken some time but I have bit by bit began to understand it better. WxWidgets has some Documentation and 
one channel in youtube called Luke's Dev Tutorials has greatly eased learning the library. Especially as his channels main theme
is building an app with the elements I need. 
Important part of the learning has been to write couple of smaller apps first and this is the bigger one which then focuses on the
main goal and reason why I began learning this UI library. 

### Next goals
1. Have the app to be able to be drawn on.
2. Be able to save the elements in xml.
3. Exporting made possible. IMG or PNG formats
4. Have the Elements be modifiable.
5. Implement a way to bring bitmaps in and brush to add the bitmaps to the app.
